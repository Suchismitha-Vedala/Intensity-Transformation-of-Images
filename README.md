Intensity Transformation

The goal of the project is to perform Intensity transformation of images. Various operations have to be performed to obtain the objective. Image negatives, Power Law transformation, histogram matching and histogram equalization operations are the operations considered to enhance the intensity of the images in this project. To visualize the transformation, we need to design a User Interface.  The User interface should allow to upload an image and let the user choose an operation that is used to enhance the given image. The objective is to let user visualize the input and the enhanced image that lets the user to compare the outputs. The project is intended to perform operations on both gray scale and color images.
